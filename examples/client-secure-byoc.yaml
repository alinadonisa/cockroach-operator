# This config file demonstrates how to connect to the CockroachDB StatefulSet
# deployed using the Kubernetes Operator.
#
# The pod that this file defines will sleep in the cluster not using any
# resources. After creating the pod, you can use it to open up a SQL shell to
# the database by running:
#
# kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --url="postgres://root@cockroachdb-public:26257/?sslmode=verify-full&sslcert=/cockroach-certs/client.root.crt&sslkey=/cockroach-certs/client.root.key&sslrootcert=/cockroach-certs/ca.crt"
